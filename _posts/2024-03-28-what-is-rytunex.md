## Introduction

RyTuneX is all about making your Windows experience better.

I've developed an optimizer using the WinUI 3 framework to boost the performance of your Windows 10 and 11 devices. With RyTuneX, you can easily remove stubborn pre-installed apps, reclaim storage space, and disable unnecessary background services for smoother performance.

## How everything started

Before RyTuneX, I created RGH Optimizer and Perfexa to optimize gaming PCs. Seeking improvement, RyTuneX emerged from personal experiences and lessons learned. It's more than an optimizer; it's a refined solution born from a commitment to continuous improvement, addressing the evolving needs of the community.
